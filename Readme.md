# 🚴 Machine Learning – BoomBikes Demand Prediction

## 📊 Overview
This project aims to help **BoomBikes**, a US-based bike-sharing service, recover from the COVID-19 business downturn by predicting daily bike rental demand. Using regression techniques and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project identifies key factors influencing demand and builds a reliable prediction model.
